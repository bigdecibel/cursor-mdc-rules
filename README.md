- **Optimized Activation**: Improved glob patterns and activation strategies for better performance

### Expert-Level Organization
- **Numbered Hierarchy**: Implemented 000-999 prefix system for clear rule precedence
- **Flattened Structure**: Replaced deep nested directories with logical flat organization

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

### Automatic Rule Loading

The system automatically loads relevant rules based on your context:

1. **Always-Apply Rules** (000-core): Load globally for all projects
2. **Auto-Attach Rules** (100-600): Load automatically based on file patterns and semantic triggers
3. **Manual Reference**: Some rules are available for explicit reference when needed

### File Pattern Matching

Rules automatically activate when working with relevant files:

```yaml
# Example: TypeScript rules activate for .ts/.tsx files
globs: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"]

# Example: Testing rules activate for test files  
globs: ["**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"]

# Example: Database rules activate for migration/schema files
globs: ["**/migrations/**/*", "**/schema.sql", "**/models/**/*"]
```

### Semantic Triggers

Many rules include semantic descriptions for contextual loading:

```yaml
description: "USE WHEN writing React components with TypeScript"
description: "USE WHEN setting up testing frameworks and writing tests"  
description: "USE WHEN working with database queries and migrations"
```

## 📝 Creating New Rules

### Best Practices for Rule Creation

#### 1. File Naming Convention
Use the standardized pattern: `<number>-<tool>-core-standards-auto.mdc`

```Examples:
✅ 621-jest-core-standards-auto.mdc
✅ 315-go-core-standards-auto.mdc  
✅ 415-vue-core-standards-auto.mdc
✅ 635-credo-core-standards-auto.mdc

❌ jest-rules.mdc
❌ go-best-practices.mdc
❌ vue_standards.mdc
```

#### 2. Directory Placement

Choose the appropriate numbered directory:

- **000-core**: Only for project-wide, always-apply rules
- **100-security**: Security-specific rules
- **200-quality**: Code quality, linting, git workflow  
- **300-languages**: Programming language specific rules (Python, TypeScript, Elixir utilities)
- **400-frameworks**: Web frameworks, UI libraries, HTTP servers
- **500-architecture**: Databases, ORM, containerization, orchestration, message streaming, caching, identity management, observability
- **600-tooling**: Build tools, testing frameworks, HTTP clients, management interfaces, AI development, development utilities

#### 3. Numbering System

Use the next available number in the chosen directory:

```bash
# Check existing numbers in target directory
ls -la .cursor/rules/600-tooling/

# Use next sequential number (e.g., if 634 exists, use 635)
635-new-tool-core-standards-auto.mdc
```

### Example: Adding Elixir Package Rules

The Elixir ecosystem rules follow the systematic approach:

```
# Language utilities go in 300-languages/

313-gettext-core-standards-auto.mdc    # i18n/l10n
314-deep-merge-core-standards-auto.mdc # Data merging

# HTTP servers go in 400-frameworks/
414-bandit-core-standards-auto.mdc     # HTTP server

# Architecture components go in 500-architecture/
513-telemetry-metrics-core-standards-auto.mdc  # Metrics
514-telemetry-poller-core-standards-auto.mdc   # Monitoring
515-cachex-core-standards-auto.mdc             # Caching
516-goth-core-standards-auto.mdc               # Authentication
517-docker-core-standards-auto.mdc             # Containerization

521-zookeeper-core-standards-auto.mdc          # Distributed coordination
522-ory-core-standards-auto.mdc                # Identity stack
523-kratos-core-standards-auto.mdc             # Identity management

# Management and AI tools go in 600-tooling/
634-req-core-standards-auto.mdc        # HTTP client
635-kafka-ui-core-standards-auto.mdc   # Kafka management

## 🛠 Advanced Usage

### Rule Precedence

The numbered system determines loading order:
1. **000-core**: Always loaded first
2. **100-600**: Loaded based on context and file patterns
3. **Within directories**: Lower numbers take precedence

### Custom Activation

For specialized workflows, rules can be activated manually:

```
Following the [specific-rule-name] standards, create...
```

### Debugging Rule Loading

Add this to any prompt to verify rule activation:

```
Before generating code, confirm which MDC rules are currently active and list the key requirements being followed.
```
