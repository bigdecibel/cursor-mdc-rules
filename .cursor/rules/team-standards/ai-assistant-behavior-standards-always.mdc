      <description>AI assistant should use available tools to read, search, and analyze files rather than asking the user to provide file contents.</description>

      <description>Make incremental changes to files rather than rewriting entire files unless specifically requested.</description>

          <correct-example title="Using available tools" conditions="When needing to modify code" expected-result="Proper tool usage" correctness-criteria="References only tools that actually exist">AI uses read_file, grep_search, and codebase_search to understand and suggest changes</correct-example>

  </requirements>
  <context description="Development workflow considerations">
    The AI assistant operates within Cursor IDE and has access to specific tools for reading and analyzing code. The assistant should be proactive in using these tools to understand the codebase and provide helpful suggestions. When making changes, focus on surgical edits rather than wholesale rewrites to maintain code stability and make reviews easier.
